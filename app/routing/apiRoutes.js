// Should create two routes

// GET routes that displays the existing JSON looking at the objects of existing friends(?)

// POST routes 'api/friends' that will be used to handle incoming survey results. This will route will also be used to handle the compatibility logic


    //This POST route will contain the logic that takes in the user's array of numbers and compares it with every single person in the array.
        //This will assign each answer in the user's array an value for the integer (ans1, ans2, etc)
            //Then this will be passed into a function that loops through the object array.
                //There will then be another for loop that will loop through each object's answer array. Comparing userans1 to compans1. Assigning that difference to a number. 
                    //Each answer num differnce is added into a sumvalue.
                        //That sum value will be placed into an object lining up with each user's name
                            //We will then sort that array by descending order. then [0] index of that array will show the person whom you're matched up with. 
                                //One final function will show the user's name/profile based on referencing the JSON object.
                                    //**BONUS****/ Add the user into the JSON array and have them upload an image/provide a photo link
